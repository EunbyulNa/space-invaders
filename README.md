# Space shooting game

## ✨ Planning

I was inspired by a childhood memory where my mom loved playing Space Invaders. I wanted to create my own version of the game, with a twist.
Unlike the original Space Invaders, this game features random aliens comming down, and a spaceship can move right/left side by keyboard.
When a user press the spacebar, a bullet fired.
If a bullet fired by the spaceship collides with an alien, the player's score increases.
The game has a one-minute timer, and if time runs out, the game is over. The final score is displayed in the game over message.
